== Lesson 1 overview

React4xp is made to cover many ways of combining XP and react. Let's start with a simple scenario: just displaying a working react component in content studio.

We'll first do that in the serverside rendered way (this is the react4xp default). And afterwards add an option flag that turns the rendering into clientside-rendering instead.

We'll do this by adding a *regular XP page controller* we'll call _hello-react_:

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/pages/hello-react/
  hello-react.xml
  hello-react.jsx
  hello-react.es6
----

These files are not included in the starter - use your copy/paste skills and remember that `hello-react` must be identical between file names and folder name.

[[page_definition]]
=== Page definition
First, we need a *page definition* XML file. Just XP boilerplate:

.hello-react.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<page>
  <display-name>Hello React</display-name>
  <description>Super simple example</description>
  <form />
</page>
----

{zwsp} +

[[react_component]]
=== React component
Next, we'll add the *react component*. This displays a "Hello world" heading, and we'll add some simple functionality to it: every time you click the message, it will update a number in the next line and print a message in the console. This is to show that we're rendering an _active_ react component; we're not only using JSX as an XP templating language for static HTML - although sure, you could do that too if you want.

Obviously, the actual updating step is done with vanilla JS instead of actual react, just to keep everything as simple as possible. We'll look at stateful/dynamic components later.

.hello-react.jsx
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

let bottleCount = 99;
function dropBottle() {
    bottleCount--;
    console.log(bottleCount, 'bottles of beer on the wall.');
    document.getElementById('counter').innerText = bottleCount;
};

export default (props) => <div onClick={dropBottle}>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Click me: <span id="counter">{bottleCount}</span> bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
</div>;
----

[NOTE]
====
One thing is mandatory for this to work, shown in the last line: the JSX file *must default-export a function* that *_may_ take a props object* and *_must_ return a react component*. <<4-source-file-structure#, More on this later>>.

Apart from that, you can use ordinary ES6 and import and nest other JS, react components and third-party stuff from _node_modules/_ in the regular way (there is a caveat or two here. <<6-imports-and-dependency-chunks#, We'll get back to that later too>>).

=== Page controller
Finally, we'll add a bare-bone *page controller* that calls the rendering engine:

[[first_helloreact_jsx]]
.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');       // <1>

exports.get = function(request) {                       // <2>
    const entry = portal.getComponent();                // <3>
    const props = null;

    return React4xp.render(                             // <4>
        entry,
        props,
        request,
        {
            id: "react4xpApp",                          // <5>
            body:                                       // <6>
                `
                    <html>
                        <head></head>
                        <body class="xp-page">
                            <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                        </body>
                    </html>
                `
        }
    )
};
----

That's it.

If you've used XP before, you'll probably note that there's no HTML view file, no `thymeleaf.render`, and so on - in this example, react4xp completely handles the page view. The essential thing here is that at the end of the `get` function, *react4xp in a single _.render_ call creates a _full_ XP response object that makes react work.*

What's going on in the controller?

<1> In line 2, `React4xp` is imported from the library.
<2> In line 4, we pick up the `request` data. The render call needs it to know the rendering context.
<3> In line 5, we get the XP component data. Used directly in the `.render` call, it's a convenient shortcut for react4xp to "this XP component", for finding the same-name react component in the same folder: _hello-react.jsx_. React4xp has more ways to refer to react components, or _entries_ (we'll get to that, but for all the details: <<entries#, entries>> and <<jsxpath#, jsxPath>>).
<4> In line 8, the juicy bit: *the actual render call*. The rendered response from it can be returned directly from the `get` function, since `.render` creates an object with a `body` HTML string and a `pageContributions` attribute with everything needed (more details: <<api#react4xp_render, the render API>>).
<5> In line 13, the `id` attribute _"react4xpApp"_ is set in the *options* argument of `.render` (lines 12-20). This is the unique ID we're giving to the react component, and the HTML id of the target element where react will render the component in the end. Note that the same ID is found in an element in the HTML `body`:
<6> In lines 14-19, we're hardcoding a `body` option, an HTML string as a base for the output, with a _"react4xpApp"_ ID element. In many cases you can do without this string but here it's needed for the output, since react itself doesn't like to render the tags `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` or anything outside of a containing root tag (such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`).

[[first_setup_render]]
== Setup and first render

If you've added those 3 files, let's get this rendered! If you've used XP and Content Studio before, this is all run-of-the mill:

1. Compile the project (`enonic project deploy` in a terminal from root) and start the sandbox (`enonic sandbox start`),
2. Navigate your browser to `localhost:8080/admin`. Log in to XP and open Content Studio (if you haven't already, you'll need to link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[install Content Studio] in XP).
3. Create a new Site content and Edit it in a new tab. Add your react4xp app (_"starter-react4xp"_?) on the upper left.
4. Select the new _Hello-react_ page controller in the preview panel on the right. Store that change (and refresh the page if needed).

You should now see something like this:

[.thumb]
image:hello_cs.png[title="Editing in Content Studio: Hello World. Click to see a high-res version", width=720px]

{zwsp} +

[start=5]
5. Click _Preview_ on the top to open a new tab and view the content outside of Content Studio:

[.thumb]
image:hello_bottles.png[title="Rendering: Hello World and some bottles on a wall somewhere. Bet you clicked this screenshot, didn't you?", width=720px]

{zwsp} +

Clicking somewhere on the rendered text in the preview window will trigger the `dropBottle` function from _hello-react.jsx_, and modify the DOM and output a message in the browser console. Look at those bottles go!

{zwsp} +

== About the rendering

Two things are worth knowing about the rendering, before we move on:

{zwsp} +

[[static_cs_rendering]]
=== Content studio only has static rendering

If you clicked the rendering _inside XP Content Studio_ instead of a preview tab, you'd notice there was *no bottle-counting*. This is on purpose: react functionality may intervene with the Content Studio editorial workflow, or even disrupt Content Studio itself. Therefore, the `request` argument is used in `React4xp.render` to handle this automatically: inside Content Studio, you'll only see the rendering as a regular static XP preview / placeholder instead of active react.

NOTE: Later, we'll look at two other rendering functions: `.renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions`. These are intended for use cases where it's good to be more explicit than `React4xp.render`. For that reason, they _don't automatically handle this for you_. Usually, you should still keep your components from being client-activated inside Content Studio, but you'll have to handle it yourself. <<5-custom-flow-syntax#, Lesson 5 shows you how>>.

{zwsp} +

=== First serverside render can be slow

You may also have noticed that it took a few seconds for the very first rendering to be displayed, either here or in the edit/browse mode in Content Studio. That's the *Nashorn server-side rendering engine warming up*. It reads and caches the basics (notably, some necessary polyfilling, react and react-dom) for performance.

We're looking into mitigating this delay in the future, but for now, this is nice to know: *This delay only happens when your app is restarted*, i.e. you restart XP entirely, or redeploy the app. Setting up a continuous build with XP devmode instead, helps. For the react4xp starter, here's how:

  1. `enonic sandbox start <yourSandBoxName> --dev` in one terminal (from anywhere), and

  2. `enonic project deploy && gradlew react4xp_components compileXP -t` from project root in another terminal. Reply _No_ if it asks you to start the sandbox here.

{zwsp} +

[[hello_output]]
== Output

Okay, back to the rendering of the page. Open the *page source* code in the browser. Here's what `React4xp.render` created - the response the client receives on the initial page request:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body class="xp-page">

    <div id="react4xpApp">
        <div data-reactroot="">                     <!--1-->
            <h1>Hello world!</h1>
            <p>Click me: <span id="counter">99</span> bottles of beer on the wall. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/externals.489d97cdf.js"></script>      <!--2-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp-client/"></script>                     <!--3-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/site/pages/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script>  <!--4-->
    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate(                                                        <!--5-->
            React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react'],
            "react4xpApp",
            null,
            1, 0);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
----
We can see this whole output is actually the `body` HTML string we passed into the `React4xp.render` call in the controller - but *a lot has been inserted*. Most importantly, three assets are loaded into the client.

(The asset URLs are shortened for readability, and because some details may vary. At my computer for example, the `(...your.app.service)` part actually looks like: `/admin/site/preview/default/draft/hello-react/_/service/com.enonic.app.react4xp/`)

<1> At the top, we see the `<div id="react4xpApp">` target container, now filled with a server-side rendering of the react component. At this point it's only static markup, but it will be activated during step 5 below.
<2> The first asset is `externals.<contenthash>.js`: this is react and react-dom bundled together. They are served from XP instead of from a CDN. If you want to read more about why, or how to tweak the externals, see the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-externals[externals docs on NPM].
<3> The second loaded asset is a client-wrapper, available in the browser's namespace as `React4xp.CLIENT`. For more, see the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client[client wrapper docs on NPM].
<4> The third asset is the compiled version of _hello-react.jsx_, with the react component and the `dropBottle` routine. During `React4xp.render`, react4xp used the `component` data to locate this asset _after_ compiling. The react component gets an identifier string, `site/pages/hello-react/hello-react`, which is called a _jsxPath_ in react4xp. We'll cover jsxPaths later (full detail reference <<jsxpath#, here>>), but for now you just need to know that this identifier is also used when loading this asset into the the browser's namespace: `React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react']`.
<5> Finally, the trigger. The CLIENT wrapper calls link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client#hydrate[hydrate] to activate react in the serverside-rendered asset `React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react']` in the target container `"react4xpApp"`. Now the `dropBottle` function works! We haven't added any props yet, hence the `null` argument. The final two digits `1, 0` are internal react4xp housekeeping, flagging some possible need for client-side postprocessing.

NOTE: The assets are served by lib-react4xp services. Most of them (_react4xp-client_ and the content-hashed assets) are optimized for client-side caching, to minimize repeated requests.

== Client-side rendering

Sometimes you might want or need to skip the server-side rendering of a react component, and relay the react rendering entirely to the browser. This a one-line operation in `React4xp.render`.

Let's return to *the controller* and add a line on line 23:


.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const entry = portal.getComponent();
    const props = null;

    return React4xp.render(
        entry,
        props,
        request,
        {
            id: "react4xpApp",
            body:
                `
                    <html>
                        <head></head>
                        <body class="xp-page">
                            <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                        </body>
                    </html>
                `,
            clientRender: true                          // <1>
        }
    )
};
----
<1> On the server, a truthy `clientRender` flag in the _options_ object makes the server skip the HTML rendering (in _this_ particular `.render` call. Mixing up clientside and serverside rendering across different places hasn't been tested very much, but it should work fine).

If you compare with <<#hello_output, the serverside-rendered example>>, the `clientRender` flag causes the *rendered output* to change slightly, changing the behavior in the browser.

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body class="xp-page">

    <div id="react4xpApp"></div>    <!--1-->

    <!--2-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/externals.489d97cdf.js"></script>
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp-client/"></script>
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/site/pages/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script>

    <script defer>
        <!--3-->
        React4xp.CLIENT.render(
            React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react'],
            "react4xpApp",
            null,
            1, 0);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
----
<1> As expected, the target container is no longer filled with a serverside-rendered HTML representation of the react component. Instead, the browser fills in the DOM from scratch in step 3 below.
<2> The compiled assets and their URLs are exactly the same as in the serverside version.
<3> The trigger is changed: the `React4xp.CLIENT` wrapper calls link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client#render[render] and makes the browser build the DOM inside the target element from scratch (instead of calling `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate`, which activates/replaces existing HTML). The function signatures of `React4xp.CLIENT.render` and `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate` are identical.

NOTE: <<#static_cs_rendering, As mentioned before>>, this only applies _outside_ of Content Studio. The `clientRender` flag does not change anything inside Content Studio: still server-side rendered static HTML.

Apart from these differences behind the scenes, the page will look and behave the same when presented to the user.

Finally, it's worth mentioning a special case where you might want to _temporarily_ clientside-render a component:

[TIP]
====
You might get _serverside runtime errors_ in the react components that you write. The Nashorn rendering engine will dump an error message and some suspected code in the server log - but it's not always easy to make sense of those.

Often, switching over to _clientside rendering_ for that particular react component, will give you a better/sourcemapped error message in the browser console, making your debugging life easier.
