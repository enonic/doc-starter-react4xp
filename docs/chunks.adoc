== What is a chunk?
A dependency chunk is *a compiled asset that can contain multiple components* that are used at runtime.

Think of it as a *library* of secondary resources that can be used by <<entries#, entries>> (or by other chunks).

Dependency chunks are served by react4xp to the client and used there. They may contain JS, or other types of code.

== Importing
Entries and other chunks can import resources from chunks using *ordinary ES6 imports*, as long as the necessary webpack rules are added. Compilation rules for regular ES6 and JSX are included with react4xp. Other rules (loaders etc) you must add yourself - see <<6-imports-and-dependency-chunks#_adding_webpack_rules, lesson 6>>.

== Standard chunks

In the standard react4xp setup, two chunks are likely to appear without any further setup: *externals and vendors*. That is, their names are hashed and will appear as `externals.<hash>.js` and `vendors.<hash>.js`.

- Externals usually contains react and react-dom, ensuring that the same react version is used when rendering on the client and server.
- Vendors is the chunk for anything else imported from _node_modules_.

== Defining chunk structure

You can also *define your own dependency chunk structure*. Additional folders (relative to _src/main/resources/react4xp/_) can be defined with `chunkDirs` in _react4xp.properties_. This will cause all source files under each chunkDir to be compiled into one common dependency chunk (or to be precise: one chunk for each codetype defined by webpack rules, e.g. separate JS and CSS chunks).

- The asset's name will be the name of the parent folder, with a content hash: <chunkName>.<hash>.<extension>.
- For example, adding `chunkDirs = foo/bar` under _react4xp.properties_, adding _hey.js_ and _baz/ho.js_ and importing stuff from _hey_ and _ho_ in an entry, will create the dependency chunk _bar.<hash>.js_ - which contains both _hey_ and _ho_.

== Importing from outside of chunkDirs

What happens if an entry imports something from folders *not marked as chunkDirs*?

- Importing an entry into anonther entry is possible, and leaves both entries compiled and handled as regular entries.
- Imported JS (react components etc) from non-entry folders will be *compiled into the entry asset* itself. Try to avoid this, since the entries can become bloated, and code can become repeated if it's imported into more than entry. The entry assets are also less performance optimized.
- Non-JS imports (CSS etc), are compiled to separate assets under their own name, the same way as entries (but are not given a _jsxPath_, of course).

== Entries vs chunks

Dependency chunks never contain <<entries#, entries>>; each entry is an asset file of its own. Consequently, nothing inside a dependency chunk will have a jsxPath.

This is why entries are used as a separate word from react components: all entries are react components, but all react components are not necessarily entries: react components can also be secondary imports from chunks / chunkDirs.

Only entries are runtime-available to react4xp.

== Why? For optimization!

Why use chunks?

They are handy for collecting related secondary resources (that may be frequently used together in one part of a site but not others, for instance - making it possible to minimize the necessary client downloads).

But most importantly, they are *automatically optimized for performance*:

- They are both cached on the server side as well as in the client - preventing repeated generation and minimizing downloads, speeding up the site.
- The hash is updated by content, for effective cache busting.
- Even if the resources in a chunk are used more than once on a page, the chunk is only downloaded once.

*Recommended usage:* chunks are made to be *fire-and-forget*. Define the chunkDir, some webpack rules if necessary, and import it from your entry (or your secondary components inside chunks) - react4xp will handle the rest. Dependencies are tracked, so `React4xp.render` (and `.renderPageContributions`) automatically adds extra client-side links to necessary chunks.

Since chunks are most optimized for repeated usage, it's best to put your heavy components and resources in chunks, and *let the entries stay slim and lightweight*.
